# Project Overview

Project Name: Ancient Egypt AI Explorer (Mock)

Description: A web application that *simulates* an AI-powered exploration of Ancient Egypt. Users can interact with a range of features, all powered by mocked AI, providing an engaging and educational experience.

Features:

*   Ask the Pharaoh (Mock AI Chat): Users can "ask" famous pharaohs questions and receive creative, AI-generated responses based on historical knowledge (mocked, of course!).
*   Hieroglyphic Translator (Mock AI): Users can input text and receive a simulated translation into hieroglyphs, or vice versa.
*   Build a Pyramid (Interactive Mock): A drag-and-drop interface where users can "build" a pyramid, learning about the construction process and key architectural elements with mocked AI insights.
*   Ancient Artifact Identifier (Mock AI): Users can upload images (or select from a library) and receive a simulated AI analysis identifying the artifact and providing historical context.

Technology Stack:

*   Cloudflare next-on-pages framework (NextJS) for the web application.
